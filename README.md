# Arduino-Keyer-KW5GP

Using Sketchup, I made a 3D printed case for the morse code keyer project described in the red book 'Arduino for Ham Radio' by KW5GP.
Note: to compile the code use the Nokia 5110 library from: http://www.rinkydinkelectronics.com/library.php?id=48
The STL files are for a larger switch and an arduino nano. 

Edit the code to change the Callsign to your own and you can also edit to change the pitch to what you'd like. 

Here's a short video of a previous build using UNO3.

You can wire the keyer straight to the board if you prefer.
